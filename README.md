## Research which informed this poster

### Round numbers up to the nearest whole number
Do not use decimals unless it’s money.

Research has shown that it’s easier for people to understand content when there are fewer digits on the page. 

### Leave space around numbers
Do not overwhelm people with too much content 

Prioritise the most important information for a user, whether that’s numbers or words. 

This is important because dyscalculia can cause numbers to look wavy or appear to jump around on the page. It takes a lot of concentration to read them. 

Dyscalculia often co-occurs with dyslexia, so by making all content (numbers and words) clear and easy to understand, a design is more accessible and inclusive. 

### Fill in the information you already have
Do not expect users to repeat or remember numbers.

Many people with dyscalculia have issues with working memory so remembering numbers is difficult. Let technology to do the work for users instead.

### Use sentences to add context about numbers
Do not use tables or grids without explaining what the numbers mean.

Research has shown that people find it easier to understand utility bills and payment plans when the numbers are presented in sentences. Adding context helps to make the meaning clearer. 

### Let people include spaces when entering numbers
Do not rush users to enter a number accurately.

This is because people might take more attempts to enter numbers accurately. Try not to set any time limits.

### Do user research with people who struggle with numbers
Do not force people to enter a number or do a sum to verify themselves.

People with dyscalculia have trouble doing calculations and recalling math facts and concepts. Forcing people to do sums to verify identity or access a system is likely to exclude them. Tell people about a different way to complete the task which doesn’t involve entering numbers, for instance by using face recognition.

If they must enter a number, let them paste it in or give them a recognisable format to help enter the number.
